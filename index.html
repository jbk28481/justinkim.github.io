<P><B>I will be writing about my semester so far. This semester has been tough for me personally because I feel compelled to do better than ever before
because its my first semester since changing my major to Accounting. The class is tough for me, but the change in my major was a necessary step to take.
I was previously a Pre-Pharmacy major in which I feel like I was in a way forced to do, not because I liked it. I absolutely had no reason to stay in a major in 
which I was going to regret later on in life. This class is a pre-requisite to a class I have to take next semester. I feel rather relieved after I changed my major
since that burden was finally off my shoulders and I can finally do what I want. Yet, it's only going to get harder from here as I need to prepare to apply to 
Terry College next semester.</B></P>
<P><B>Another thing I liked to talk about is my transition from Georgia State to here, at UGA. I first went to Georgia State during my freshman year, than I transferred 
here to UGA. Honestly, I didn't like my experience at Georgia State at all, plus being in the city life was definetly not for me. Personally, I find Atlanta boring and
find Athens a lot more fun, despite what my friends tell me. The transition from the city to the outskirts of Georgia, ended up being a better decision I don't regret taking.
I found that i'm having a much more fun and better college expierience here at UGA, than I did or ever will at Georgia State if I had decided to stay. Being at Georgia State 
was not very exciting in terms of having a "real" college experience, at least not compared to here or even at Georgia Tech.</B></P>
<P><B>The one thing I love the most about being in Athens, is pretty much everything in comparison to Atlanta. The atmosphere is here has a more comforting vibe to it, the food 
here is better in my opinion, plus im much more closer to friends here then Atlanta, and the list of reasons goes on and on. The never ending UGA school pride is beyond anything I will ever get to 
experience if i were to attend any other university in Georgia. The one thing I have not done yet since coming here is attending one of UGA's many football games during the fall.
The time will come though, and getting to a sea of red is something I look foward too in the very near future. Having a much better education here is also nice to have, despite being 
more rigorous, it's something I'm willing to work hard for in order to stay and graduate here. I find Athens to be a much more pleasureable place to be than Atlanta.</B></P>
